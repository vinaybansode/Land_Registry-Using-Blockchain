# Land Registry System using Blockchain

## Overview
The **Land Registry System** is a decentralized application (**DApp**) built using **Blockchain** technology to securely and transparently maintain the ownership and transfer of land records. This system utilizes blockchain's immutability to eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce fraud in land transactions.

## Features

- **Immutable Records**: Once a record is added to the blockchain, it is permanent, offering a verifiable record of land ownership.
- **Efficient Transactions**: Buyers and sellers can conduct land transactions securely without relying on centralized authorities.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automatically enforce the terms of land transactions, ensuring both parties meet their obligations.
- **Decentralized and Transparent**: All transactions are transparent and visible to all network participants, promoting trust and fairness.
